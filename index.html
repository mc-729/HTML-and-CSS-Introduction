            I created this in a 3D modeling/animation software called Houdini.
            My goal was to create a boba-tea drink using the software as my first project.
            I was able to create a network of nodes and use cylindrical and spherical objects to imitate a boba-tea drink.
            Since this was my first project, this was not perfect but gave me a basic understanding of how to use Houdini's nodes and network systems.
