            This is the projects page paragraph tag. I'm not too sure what to write here but I hope this was done correctly.

                A hobby of mine is that I like to collect figurines from games, shows, pop culture, and have them signed by famous actors.
                I've meet a couple voice actors in conventions before and have taken my photos with them. The costs of all of this is quite expensive.
